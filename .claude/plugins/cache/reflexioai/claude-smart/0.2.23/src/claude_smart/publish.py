"""Publish-to-reflexio orchestration used by Stop, SessionEnd, and the sync CLI.

One helper — ``publish_unpublished`` — owns the read-buffer → slice → publish →
stamp-watermark sequence so the three call sites stay in sync. Returns a
``(status, interaction_count)`` tuple so callers can format appropriate
messaging without peeking at the adapter.

    """Drain the session buffer to reflexio and stamp the high-water mark.

    Args:
        session_id (str): Claude Code session id, attached to each interaction.
        project_id (str): Stable project name; used as reflexio's
            ``user_id`` (preferences) so preferences accumulate at the project
            level across sessions. ``agent_version`` is hardcoded to
            ``"claude-code"`` in the adapter so skills roll up
            globally per agent rather than per project.
        force_extraction (bool): Whether to ask reflexio to run extraction
            synchronously instead of queuing for the next sweep.
        skip_aggregation (bool): When True, reflexio extracts preferences and
            raw project-specific skill entries but skips the rollup into
            shared skills. claude-smart passes False on every publish
            path so ``user_playbooks`` roll up into ``agent_playbooks``; aggregation
            additionally requires `aggregation_config` to be set on
            reflexio's `user_playbook_extractor_configs[0]` and
            `optimize_agent_playbooks=true` at the top level — otherwise
            the rollup silently no-ops.
        adapter (Adapter | None): Injection point for tests; a fresh
            ``Adapter()`` is constructed when omitted.

    Returns:
        tuple[PublishStatus, int]: ``("nothing", 0)`` if the buffer has no
            unpublished turns, ``("ok", n)`` after a successful publish of
            ``n`` interactions, or ``("failed", n)`` if reflexio rejected or
            was unreachable. On ``"failed"`` the watermark is not advanced,
            so the next hook retries the same batch.
