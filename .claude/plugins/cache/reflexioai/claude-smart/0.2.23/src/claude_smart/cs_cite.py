"""Support helpers for claude-smart citation tracking.

Context injected by UserPromptSubmit / PreToolUse tags each skill and
preference bullet with a rank-based id fingerprinted by the underlying
real id (``[cs:s1-1a2b]`` for the first skill whose
``user_playbook_id`` starts with ``1a2b``, ``[cs:p2-c3d4]`` for the
second preference). The injected instruction asks the assistant to end
impactful replies with a marker like::

    ✨ 1 claude-smart learning applied [cs:s1-1a2b]

The Stop hook later scans the assistant text for those markers and resolves
the ids against a per-session registry persisted at
``~/.claude-smart/sessions/<session_id>.injected.jsonl``. Legacy ``cs-cite``
Bash tool calls are still accepted as a fallback for older instructions.

Why rank + fingerprint: rank alone resets at every injection, so a
later injection's ``s1`` would silently overwrite an earlier entry in
the append-only registry — if Claude cited ``s1`` across a turn
boundary, the resolver would pick the wrong skill. Appending the
first four alphanumeric chars of the real id makes the id stable
across injections in the common case (distinct real ids → distinct
fingerprints), so cross-injection collisions become rare.

This module holds:

- ``rank_id``: ``p{n}-{fp}`` / ``s{n}-{fp}`` tag for a given
  (kind, rank, real_id) tuple. Fingerprint is omitted when no real id
  is available. ``p`` is preference, ``s`` is skill.
- ``CITATION_CMD_RE``: regex matching a valid legacy ``cs-cite`` command line.
- ``ensure_installed``: idempotent copy of ``plugin/bin/cs-cite`` to
  ``~/.claude-smart/bin/cs-cite`` with the executable bit set.
- ``CITATION_INSTRUCTION``: the trailer text appended to injected context
  so the assistant knows when and how to emit the citation marker.
