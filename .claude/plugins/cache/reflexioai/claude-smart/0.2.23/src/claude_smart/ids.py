"""Resolve stable identifiers for Claude Code sessions.

Two identifiers matter to reflexio:

- ``session_id``: Claude Code's per-session id, passed in hook stdin. We
  forward it to reflexio's interaction ``session_id`` field so individual
  turns remain attributable to their conversation, but it is no longer
  the scope key for extracted preferences.
- ``project_id``: a stable, cross-session name for the project. We use
  this as reflexio's ``user_id`` for preferences, so user preferences
  extracted in one session are visible to every later session in the
  same repo. ``agent_version`` is hardcoded to ``"claude-code"`` in the
  adapter so shared skills roll up globally across all projects rather than
  per project.
