#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Wrapper for slash commands that invoke the claude_smart CLI via uv.
# Claude Code runs `!` bash directives in slash command .md files in a
# non-interactive, non-login shell that does NOT source ~/.zshrc or
# ~/.bash_profile. As a result, binaries installed by smart-install.sh
# at ~/.local/bin (e.g. uv from the astral.sh installer) are invisible
# to those directives until the user manually re-sources their shell rc.
# This wrapper bootstraps PATH the same way hook_entry.sh does so the
# slash commands work on a fresh install.
